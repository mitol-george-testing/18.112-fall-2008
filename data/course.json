  "course_description": "This is an advanced undergraduate course dealing with calculus in one complex variable with geometric emphasis. Since the course Analysis I (18.100B) is a prerequisite, topological notions like compactness, connectedness, and related properties of continuous functions are taken for granted.\n\nThis course offers biweekly problem sets with solutions, two term tests and a final exam, all with solutions.\n",
